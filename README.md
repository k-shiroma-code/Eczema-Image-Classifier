Medical Image Classifier (Computer Vision)
"Skin Lesion Detector"
Goal: Binary classification - "Concerning" vs "Normal" skin spots
What you'll learn:

Image preprocessing and augmentation
Transfer learning with pre-trained models
Model evaluation metrics
Building a simple web interface

Tech Stack:

Python, TensorFlow/Keras
OpenCV for image processing
Streamlit for web app
Matplotlib for visualization

Dataset: Use the HAM10000 dataset (publicly available dermatology images)
Steps:

Load and explore the dataset
Preprocess images (resize, normalize)
Use transfer learning with MobileNet or ResNet
Train and evaluate the model
Create a simple web app for predictions
