# Eczema-Image-Classifier

This project develops a deep learning model to classify **eczema (atopic dermatitis) vs. non-eczema** skin images.  
It is intended as a **portfolio and research project** — not a diagnostic tool — and highlights techniques in **computer vision, model interpretability, and ethical AI in healthcare**.

## Features
- Transfer learning with **EfficientNet**, **ResNet**, and **Vision Transformers**  
- Preprocessing with **Albumentations** (color normalization, lighting adjustments, noise injection)  
- Class imbalance handling using **weighted loss functions**  
- **Grad-CAM visualizations** for model interpretability  
- Evaluation with **AUROC, F1-score, sensitivity/specificity**  
- Modular pipeline for reproducibility (data → preprocessing → training → evaluation → interpretability)
